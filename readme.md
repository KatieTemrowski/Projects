# Final for Data Personalization


# Memories of Teenage Love

So I designed this app based on a google form I made to help with research for my Big Screens piece "First Dance".I ended up making my own app (starting from the boilerplate code from class) then sending it out to more people to populate the info. Once I did that and had a api shooting out a json object with the info about people's memories of teenage love, I decided to have a sort of word cloud on a separate view for each prompt. But that did not feel right, considering the answers were these poignant and beautiful memories. I wanted to make something tangiable. So I decided to then take the responses, filter them through script pulling out important words, and seeing how many times they were used. Then from there I made a word cloud made from the responses, and printed them out to really make these responses feel as tangible as the moments of love themselves. 


# The Method
the Questionaire -> JSON/API-> different webpages -> python script -> word cloud(rune.js) -> print
